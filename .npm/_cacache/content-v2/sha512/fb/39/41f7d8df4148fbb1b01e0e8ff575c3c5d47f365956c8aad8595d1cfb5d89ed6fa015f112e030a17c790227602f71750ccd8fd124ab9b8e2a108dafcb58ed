and package publishing-related tasks:\n\n<img align=\"right\" src=\"./docs/assets/release-it.svg?raw=true\" height=\"280\" />\n\n- Bump version (in e.g. `package.json`)\n- [Git commit, tag, push][1]\n- Execute any (test or build) commands using [hooks][2]\n- [Create release at GitHub][3] or [GitLab][4]\n- [Generate changelog][5]\n- [Publish to npm][6]\n- [Manage pre-releases][7]\n- Extend with [plugins][8]\n- Release from any [CI/CD environment][9]\n\nUse release-it for version management and publish to anywhere with its versatile configuration, a powerful plugin\nsystem, and hooks to execute any command you need to test, build, and/or publish your project.\n\n[![Action Status][11]][10] [![npm version][13]][12]\n\nAre you using release-it at work? Please consider [sponsoring me][14]!\n\n## Installation\n\nAlthough release-it is a **generic** release tool, most projects use it for projects with npm packages. The recommended\nway to install release-it uses npm and adds some minimal configuration to get started:\n\n```bash\nnpm init release-it\n```\n\nAlternatively, install it manually, and add the `release` script to `package.json`:\n\n```bash\nnpm install -D release-it\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"my-package\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"release\": \"release-it\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"release-it\": \"^19.0.0\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nRun release-it from the root of the project using either `npm run` or `npx`:\n\n```bash\nnpm run release\nnpx release-it\n```\n\nYou will be prompted to select the new version, and more prompts will follow based on your configuration.\n\n## Yarn & pnpm\n\n- Using Yarn? Please see the [npm section on Yarn][15].\n- Using pnpm? Please see [release-it-pnpm][16].\n\n## Monorepos\n\nUsing a monorepo? Please see this [monorepo recipe][17].\n\n## Global Installation\n\nPer-project installation as shown above is recommended, but global installs are supported as well:\n\n- From npm: `npm install -g release-it`\n- From Homebrew: `brew install release-it`\n\n## Containerized\n\nUse [Release It! - Containerized][18] to run it in any environment as a standardized container without the need for a\nNode environment. Thanks [Juan Carlos][19]!\n\n## Videos, articles & examples\n\nHere's a list of interesting external resources:\n\n- Video: [How to use GitHub Actions & Release-It to Easily Release Your Code][20]\n- Article: [Monorepo Semantic Releases][21] ([repo][22])\n\nWant to add yours to the list? Just open a pull request!\n\n## Configuration\n\nOut of the box, release-it has sane defaults, and [plenty of options][23] to configure it. Most projects use a\n`.release-it.json` file in the project root, or a `release-it` property in `package.json`.\n\nHere's a quick example `.release-it.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://unpkg.com/release-it@19/schema/release-it.json\",\n  \"git\": {\n    \"commitMessage\": \"chore: release v${version}\"\n  },\n  \"github\": {\n    \"release\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n→ See [Configuration][24] for more details.\n\n## Interactive vs. CI mode\n\nBy default, release-it is **interactive** and allows you to confirm each task before execution:\n\n<img src=\"./docs/assets/release-it-interactive.gif?raw=true\" height=\"290\" />\n\nBy using the `--ci` option, the process is fully automated without prompts. The configured tasks will be executed as\ndemonstrated in the first animation above. In a Continuous Integration (CI) environment, this non-interactive mode is\nactivated automatically.\n\nUse `--only-version` to use a prompt only to determine the version, and automate the rest.\n\n## Latest version\n\nHow does release-it determine the latest version?\n\n1. For projects with a `package.json`, its `version` will be used (see [npm][25] to skip this).\n2. Otherwise, release-it uses the latest Git tag to determine which version should be released.\n3. As a last resort, `0.0.0` will be used as the latest version.\n\nAlternatively, a plugin can be used to override this (e.g. to manage a `VERSION` or `composer.json` file):\n\n- [@release-it/bumper][26] to read from or bump the version in any file\n- [@release-it/conventional-changelog][27] to get a recommended bump based on commit messages\n- [release-it-calver-plugin][28] to use CalVer (Calendar Versioning)\n\nAdd the `--release-version` flag to print the **next** version without releasing anything.\n\n## Git\n\nGit projects are supported well by release-it, automating the tasks to stage, commit, tag and push releases to any Git\nremote.\n\n→ See [Git][29] for more details.\n\n## GitHub Releases\n\nGitHub projects can have releases attached to Git tags, containing release notes and assets. There are two ways to add\n[GitHub releases][30] in your release-it flow:\n\n1. Automated (requires a `GITHUB_TOKEN`)\n2. Manual (using the GitHub web interface with pre-populated fields)\n\n→ See [GitHub Releases][31] for more details.\n\n## GitLab Releases\n\nGitLab projects can have releases attached to Git tags, containing release notes and assets. To automate [GitLab\nreleases][32]:\n\n- Configure `gitlab.release: true`\n- Obtain a [personal access token][33] (release-it only needs the \"api\" scope).\n- Make sure the token is [available as an environment variable][34].\n\n→ See [GitLab Releases][35] for more details.\n\n## Changelog\n\nBy default, release-it generates a changelog, to show and help select a version for the new release. Additionally, this\nchangelog serves as the release notes for the GitHub or GitLab release.\n\nThe [default command][23] is based on `git log ...`. This setting (`git.changelog`) can be overridden. To further\ncustomize the release notes for the GitHub or GitLab release, there's `github.releaseNotes` or `gitlab.releaseNotes`.\nMake sure any of these commands output the changelog to `stdout`. Note that release-it by default is agnostic to commit\nmessage conventions. Plugins are available for:\n\n- GitHub and GitLab Releases\n- auto-changelog\n- Conventional Changelog\n- Keep A Changelog\n- git-cliff\n\nTo print the changelog without releasing anything, add the `--changelog` flag.\n\n→ See [Changelog][36] for more details.\n\n## Publish to npm\n\nWith a `package.json` in the current directory, release-it will let `npm` bump the version in `package.json` (and\n`package-lock.json` if present), and publish to the npm registry.\n\n→ See [Publish to npm][25] for more details.\n\n## Manage pre-releases\n\nWith release-it, it's easy to create pre-releases: a version of your software that you want to make available, while\nit's not in the stable semver range yet. Often \"alpha\", \"beta\", and \"rc\" (release candidate) are used as identifiers for\npre-releases. An example pre-release version is `2.0.0-beta.0`.\n\n→ See [Manage pre-releases][37] for more details.\n\n## Update or re-run existing releases\n\nUse `--no-increment` to not increment the last version, but update the last existing tag/version.\n\nThis may be helpful in cases where the version was already incremented. Here are a few example scenarios:\n\n- To update or publish a (draft) GitHub Release for an existing Git tag.\n- Publishing to npm succeeded, but pushing the Git tag to the remote failed. Then use\n  `release-it --no-increment --no-npm` to skip the `npm publish` and try pushing the same Git tag again.\n\n## Hooks\n\nUse script hooks to run shell commands at any moment during the release process (such as `before:init` or\n`after:release`).\n\nThe format is `[prefix]:[hook]` or `[prefix]:[plugin]:[hook]`:\n\n| part   | value                                       |\n| ------ | ------------------------------------------- |\n| prefix | `before` or `after`                         |\n| plugin | `version`, `git`, `npm`, `github`, `gitlab` |\n| hook   | `init`, `bump`, `release`                   |\n\nUse the optional `:plugin` part in the middle to hook into a life cycle method exactly before or after any plugin.\n\nThe core plugins include `version`, `git`, `npm`, `github`, `gitlab`.\n\nNote that hooks like `after:git:release` will not run when either the `git push` failed, or when it is configured not to\nbe executed (e.g. `git.push: false`). See [execution order][38] for more details on execution order of plugin lifecycle\nmethods.\n\nAll commands can use configuration variables (like template strings). An array of commands can also be provided, they\nwill run one after another. Some example release-it configuration:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"hooks\": {\n    \"before:init\": [\"npm run lint\", \"npm test\"],\n    \"after:my-plugin:bump\": \"./bin/my-script.sh\",\n    \"after:bump\": \"npm run build\",\n    \"after:git:release\": \"echo After git push, before github release\",\n    \"after:release\": \"echo Successfully released ${name} v${version} to ${repo.repository}.\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe variables can be found in the [default configuration][23]. Additionally, the following variables are exposed:\n\n```text\nversion\nlatestVersion\nchangelog\nname\nrepo.remote, repo.protocol, repo.host, repo.owner, repo.repository, repo.project\nbranchName\nreleaseUrl\n```\n\nAll variables are available in all hooks. The only exception is that the additional variables listed above are not yet\navailable in the `init` hook.\n\nUse `--verbose` to log the output of the commands.\n\nFor the sake of verbosity, the full list of hooks is actually: `init`, `beforeBump`, `bump`, `beforeRelease`, `release`\nor `afterRelease`. However, hooks like `before:beforeRelease` look weird and are usually not useful in practice.\n\nNote that arguments need to be quoted properly when used from the command line:\n\n```bash\nrelease-it --'hooks.after:release=\"echo Successfully released ${name} v${version} to ${repo.repository}.\"'\n```\n\nUsing Inquirer.js inside custom hook scripts might cause issues (since release-it also uses this itself).\n\n## Dry Runs\n\nUse `--dry-run` to show the interactivity and the commands it _would_ execute.\n\n→ See [Dry Runs][39] for more details.\n\n## Troubleshooting & debugging\n\n- With `release-it --verbose` (or `-V`), release-it prints the output of every user-defined [hook][2].\n- With `release-it -VV`, release-it also prints the output of every internal command.\n- Use `NODE_DEBUG=release-it:* release-it [...]` to print configuration and more error details.\n\nUse `verbose: 2` in a configuration file to have the equivalent of `-VV` on the command line.\n\n## Plugins\n\nSince v11, release-it can be extended in many, many ways. Here are some plugins:\n\n| Plugin                                    | Description                                                                                 |\n| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [@release-it/bumper][26]                  | Read & write the version from/to any file                                                   |\n| [@release-it/conventional-changelog][27]  | Provides recommended bump, conventional-changelog, and updates `CHANGELOG.md`               |\n| [@release-it/keep-a-changelog][40]        | Maintain CHANGELOG.md using the Keep a Changelog standards                                  |\n| [@release-it-plugins/lerna-changelog][41] | Integrates lerna-changelog into the release-it pipeline                                     |\n| [@jcamp-code/release-it-changelogen][42]  | Use [@unjs/changelogen][43] for versioning and changelog                                    |\n| [@release-it-plugins/workspaces][44]      | Releases each of your projects configured workspaces                                        |\n| [release-it-calver-plugin][28]            | Enables Calendar Versioning (calver) with release-it                                        |\n| [@grupoboticario/news-fragments][45]      | An easy way to generate your changelog file                                                 |\n| [@j-ulrich/release-it-regex-bumper][46]   | Regular expression based version read/write plugin for release-it                           |\n| [@jcamp-code/release-it-dotnet][47]       | Use .csproj or .props file for versioning, automate NuGet publishing                        |\n| [release-it-pnpm][16]                     | Add basic support for pnpm workspaces, integrates with [bumpp][48] and [changelogithub][49] |\n| [changesets-release-it-plugin][50]        | Combine [Changesets][51] changelog management with release-it                               |\n\nInternally, release-it uses its own plugin architecture (for Git, GitHub, GitLab, npm).\n\n→ See all [release-it plugins on npm][52].\n\n→ See [plugins][53] for documentation to write plugins.\n\n## Use release-it programmatically\n\nWhile mostly used as a CLI tool, release-it can be used as a dependency to integrate in your own scripts.
